shortest is a function that receives a list of lists and returns the shortest 
list if there is one, and Nothing otherwise.

	shortest :: [[a]] -> Maybe [a]

Your implementation must satisfy the following requirements:
1. It must work even if there are infinite lists in the input (see *).
2. It must work even if the input list itself is infinite (see *).
3. If there are several lists with the minimal length, return the first of them.

	* We guarantee that for all test inputs (visible and hidden), it will be 
possible to find a solution within a reasonable amount of time using an 
appropriate algorithm. For example, there wonâ€™t be any infinite lists of 
infinite lists in the tests.

For example,
        shortest  [[1, 3..], [10..], repeat 5, [2, 4], [2, 4..], [42, 228]] 
            == Just [2, 4]

shortest :: Eq a => [[a]] -> Maybe [a]
shortest [[]] = Nothing
shortest [] = Nothing
shortest [x]= Just x
shortest (x:xs)
    | take 100000 x /= x = shortest xs
    | take 100000 (head xs) /= head xs = shortest (x:tail xs)
    | length x > length (head xs) = shortest xs
    | otherwise = shortest (x:tail xs)

-- how about sevaral shortest lists of the same lenght? return the first one?
-- how about infinite input lists? 
-- how to know that value is the smallest if it located in the infinite list? only eception is [] in that input list that can break the loop
-- minimum length of the list is 1, so if the list is empty, return Nothing?
